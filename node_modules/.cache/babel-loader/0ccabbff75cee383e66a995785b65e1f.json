The brackets will be made based on the number of teams participating in the tournament, so exact scheduling depends on how many teams sign up.\r\n                </Typography>\r\n                <Typography variant=\"h4\" gutterBottom>\r\n                    <br></br>\r\n                    Teams\r\n                </Typography>\r\n                <Typography variant=\"p\" gutterBottom>\r\n                All teams must be under a TDSB high school. Each school can have a maximum of two teams, an A team and a B team. The teams must consist of 5 players each and 1 substitute will be allowed per team and every player must be on only one team. The substitute must also be registered alongside the team when registering. Substitutes will only play if one of the other team members is not able to make the tournament, otherwise they aren’t participating in the tournament. We recommend creating a chess club and holding virtual tournaments at the school to decide who will be representing the school as part of their team. For more information on our recommendations, check out our documentation “Documentation - 3: Tournament Prep.” Every team also requires a teacher advisor to make sure that the teams are abiding by the rules. \r\n                </Typography>\r\n                <Typography variant=\"h4\" gutterBottom>\r\n                    <br></br>\r\n                    Chess Matches\r\n                </Typography>\r\n                <Typography variant=\"p\" gutterBottom>\r\n                All players will be playing a 10+0 rapid chess, up until the semi finals. Each player will be playing their own individual games with no outside assistance. The players will be playing a standard variation of chess where they will be assigned white or black at random. Lichess.org will be keeping time and tracking all the moves made by both players. Each team will be playing against each other for one hour and whichever team earns the most points by the end will be deemed victorious and move onto the next tournament. The other team will be eliminated. \r\n                <br></br><br></br>For the semi finals and finals, two day tournaments will be held. Each day of the semi finals and finals will be one hour and half and the chess matches will be 15+10 rapid. The team which accumulated the most points over the course of the two days will move onto the next round and opposition will be eliminated.\r\n                </Typography>\r\n                <Typography variant=\"h4\" gutterBottom>\r\n                    <br></br>\r\n                    Requirements\r\n                </Typography>\r\n                <Typography variant=\"p\" gutterBottom>\r\n                The teams must be under a TDSB highschool.

Whoever wins the chess game, their team will move on to the next round and the other team will be eliminated. This doesn’t relate to a draw between players but rather the teams accumulating the same number of points by the end of the given time.\r\n                    <br></br><br></br>\r\n                    Joining Late:\r\n                    <br></br>\r\n                    The team will be permitted 5 mins after the official start time of the match to join.
