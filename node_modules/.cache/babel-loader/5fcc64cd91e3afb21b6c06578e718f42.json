Whoever wins the chess game, their team will move on to the next round and the other team will be eliminated. This doesn’t relate to a draw between players but rather the teams accumulating the same number of points by the end of the given time.\r\n                    <br></br><br></br>\r\n                    Joining Late:\r\n                    <br></br>\r\n                    The team will be permitted 5 mins after the official start time of the match to join.
